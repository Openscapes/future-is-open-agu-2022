Session: https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm22/meetingapp.cgi/Session/161588
Abstract: What does open science look like in daily work? We’ll share stories from NASA, NOAA, and academic teams that are leveraging, collaborating, and supporting others with open science as a daily practice. Examples will weave inclusive technical and social approaches - how code, version control, notebooks, peer-teaching, screensharing, onboarding, appreciation, and shared credit contribute momentum towards broad community goals.

##  {#openscapes-intro-1 data-menu-title="Openscapes Intro 1" background-color="#0F1620" background-image="images/horst_openscapes_landscape.png" background-size="contain" background-position="bottom right" fig-alt="Illustration of a grassy field by an ocean, there’s a river that meanders from the midground to the background on the right hand side. There are mountains in the background. The Openscapes hex logo is in the top left hand corner. In the foreground there are many animals: hermit crab working alone on a laptop, a sad rabbit on a laptop under a raincloud, a frustrated skunk on a laptop under a raincloud. Just over a bush is another group of animals: a fox with a welcome sign stands with a hedgehog holding map brochures In front of a larger park map. The fox and hedgehog are in front of a group of animals: a heron, a squirrel, a mouse holding a notebook, a raccoon, a snake, and a quail. In the midground, there’s a turtle, deer, owl and beaver by the river that has stepping stone rocks across. A roadrunner, lizard, blue bird, and rabbit, are walking down a path together, one of the other paths is blocked by a log. There’s a rowboat on the edge of the water. In the background, a duck, turtle, red squirrel, fox, and raven are walking single file over a wooden bridge that crosses the river. Most of the animals have coloured bandanas tied around their necks and a few are wearing hats. Up in the sky, there’s a satellite. Overlaid on the image is the OpenScapes hex logo."}

::: notes
Openscapes is an approach and a movement that I launched in 2018 and have built together with my partner Erin Robinson. 

Our flagship activity is mentoring research teams in open science. We think of open science as a landscape full of open source software, data, and communities, and many paths forward.

## Biggest barrier: paid time for learning & doing

"I can't find 2 hours/week to improve my workflow"

"workflows are seen as 'our' problem"

"3/7 colleagues have left in the last 6 months"
